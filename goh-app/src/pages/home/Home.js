      <p>Group and collaborative environments have struggled to coordinate and 
credit the contributions done by the individuals of the group. Our goal is to deliver 
        a web application that can bring together the functionality of a project task manager 
        where users can communicate, collaborate, and track their project. Additionally, generating an analytical report of the contributions of each group member that can be viewed after the completion of the project.</p>
